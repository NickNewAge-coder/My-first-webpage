            <p>Princess Bonnibel "Bonnie" Bubblegum (often called PB and occasionally Peebles, Bub-Bubs, or P-Bubs)[5] is one of the main characters of the series Adventure Time and first appeared in the animated short.

                Princess Bubblegum is the current incarnation of the Candy Elemental. Which is comparable to the inhabitants of the Candy Kingdom, who are all composed of types of desserts and candies. She rules over the Candy Kingdom, but in the Season 6 episode "Hot Diggity Doom" (the first part of the season's finale), an election was held and she lost to the King of Ooo by a landslide. As a result, she no longer ruled the Candy Kingdom and the King of Ooo replaced her as the new ruler until a rebellion against King of Ooo allowed her to reclaim the throne in "The Dark Cloud". As of the Series Finale, Princess Bubblegum and Marceline have resumed their romantic relationship, and she is currently Marcelineâ€™s girlfriend again. </p>
