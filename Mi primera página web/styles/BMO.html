            <p>BMO (abbreviated from "Be MOre", phonetically spelled "Beemo"), also referred to as Moe Mastro "Llabtoof" Giovanni Jr., and called the "King of Ooo" in the future, is one of the main characters of Adventure Time, as well as the titular main protagonist of the Distant Lands episode of the same name. BMO is a living prototype video game console system, portable electrical outlet, computer, music player, VCR, video player, video editor, roommate, camera, alarm clock, toaster, flashlight, strobe light, skateboarder, soccer player, tape player, chef, detective and friend who is owned by Finn. They make their appearance in the title scene of the Theme Song of every episode of Adventure Time (excluding the Stakes and Elements miniseries, which have their own theme songs, and the theme song of "Come Along With Me") just as Finn and Jake pound their fists together. BMO is characterized as a loyal, trusting and helpful robot who is protective of Finn and Jake. </p>
