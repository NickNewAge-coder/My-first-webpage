            <p>Simon Petrikov, formerly known as the Ice King, is a major character in Adventure Time and a protagonist in its spin-off series Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake.

                Originally depicted as a two-dimensional, humorously over-the-top villain trying to kidnap Princess Bubblegum and various other princesses on a regular basis, the character's personality was subsequently expanded, revealing him to be a kind-hearted but misunderstood old man with completely twisted senses of morality and social behavior, suffering from loneliness and memory loss. Later seasons unveil his tragic backstory, revealing he was once a good human named Simon Petrikov who lost his mind, memories and loved ones due to the magic crown giving him his ice powers. In "Come Along With Me," Ice King is permanently reverted back to Simon after almost being digested by GOLB. </p>
